# 5113056042_HW1

This program uses a Streamlit application to perform linear regression analysis and is developed following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. Users can interactively adjust parameters, observe the impact of different variables on the regression model, and view the results in real time.

Instructions for running the app:

Install necessary libraries if you don't have them:  
```pip install streamlit scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pandas```  

Save the script as app.py and run it:  
```streamlit run 5113056042_HW1.py```  

The app will display:
